Welcome to the **SEED ROAD TO PRO CODER** repository! This is your gateway to mastering the art of coding—not just by cramming theory but by actively engaging in 50 challenging LeetCode problems. Each day, you’ll find a new problem complete with clear instructions and a dedicated space for your solution.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- **Daily Challenges:**  
  Each day has its own folder containing:
  - `instruction.py` – Detailed instructions and problem description.
  - `solution.py` – A placeholder file for you to write your solution.

- **Get Started:**
  1. **Star** this repository to show your support.
  2. **Fork** the repository to create your personal copy.
  3. **Clone** your fork locally to start coding.
  
- **Daily Routine:**
  - **Read:** Go through the `instruction.py` file for the day.
  - **Code:** Solve the challenge by editing `solution.py`.
  - **Commit & Push:** Make sure you commit your solution and push it to your GitHub before the end of the day.
  
- **Strict Daily Submission Rule:**  
  _**Every day, you must submit your solution before the day ends.**_ This is non-negotiable—it’s a commitment to your progress.
